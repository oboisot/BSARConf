# BSARConf
Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar Configurator

## Quick description
Website interface to visualize and configure bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems.\
A *real-time* rendering of the geometric configuration is made together with the computation
of some usefull BSAR parameters such as:
- bistatic angle
- slant and ground range resolutions
- slant and ground lateral resolutions
- resolution cell area
- integration time (if set to *auto-ground* or *auto-slant*)
- Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero (NESZ)
- direct drawing of ground iso-Range and iso-Doppler contours
- direct drawing of the Generalized Ambiguity Function (GAF) amplitude for a unit point scatterer
- MORE TO COMES...
