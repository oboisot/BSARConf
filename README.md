# BSARConf
Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar Configurator

## Quick description
Website interface to visualize and configure bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems.\
A *real-time* rendering of the geometric configuration is made together with the computation
of some usefull BSAR parameters such as:
- bistatic angle
- slant and ground range resolutions
- slant and ground lateral resolutions
- resolution cell area
- integration time (if set to *auto-ground* or *auto-slant*)
- Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero (NESZ)
- direct drawing of ground iso-Range and iso-Doppler contours
- direct drawing of the Generalized Ambiguity Function (GAF) amplitude for a unit point scatterer

A preview is available here:  [BSARConf](https://www.bsarconf.oboisot.com)

It is a recent project and is still under construction and improvements, MORE TO COME:
- The addition of NESZ computation must be added
- The making of a full configuration report must be added
- More informations about the site and the physics behind must be added

## Detailed description
 TO DO...

## Other projects used by this site
This site uses the:
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org) modules for 3D rendering
- [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript) scripts for 2D drawing
